## What is Zephyrus? :thinking:
Zephyrus is a generic data handler which aims to bring 'cool' back into data manipulation, making both, data stored inside of files within your file system, and data existing in different MySQL databases, a breeze to work with :wind_chime:.

Zephyrus is a sophomore university project :hammer: by **Nikola Lausev** and **David Zahorodni**.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies either by running `pipenv install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run command `python main.py`

(**Hint**: You can find a database example [here](https://github.com/University-Collab/zephyrus/tree/master/model/db_examples))
